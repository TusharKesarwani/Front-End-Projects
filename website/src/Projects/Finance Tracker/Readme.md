# NAME AND INTRODUCTION OF THE PROJECT :
## Finance Tracker- 
Its a basic Finance Tracker Website in JavaScript,Html,Css.
User interface: We will use HTML and CSS to design and style the user interface for our Finance Tracker.

Input forms: We will use HTML forms to allow users to input their income and expenses.

Local storage: We will use a browser’s local storage to store the user’s budget data.

Calculation logic: We will use JavaScript to calculate the user’s total income, expenses, and budget balance.
By adding these essential components, we will be able to create a functional Finance tracker that allows users to easily input, store, and view their Finance data. We will now go through the process of implementing each of these features in our Finance tracker application.
