## :star: [FoodHub](https://dhariwal404.github.io/Team-Avinya/foodhub_index.html)
- Enjoy food whenever and wherever you want. Just order online are delicious delicacies on food hub webpage. Now you can enjoy food by ordering it at your respective hostel. On this webpage we have integrated all the college shops with their respective QRs and menus(in development). We have also created an order system which will generate the order receipt. Our future plans are to dive into the backend side of this site with the help of razorpay and also improve the UI/UX of this webpage.

## :star: [Laundry Booking System](https://dhariwal404.github.io/Team-Avinya/laundry_index.html)
- The ultimate solution to getting your laundry done. The way laundry is handled in our college is very unorganised the entries are done in a notebook and it takes 3-4 days to get our clothes back. The days of picking up our laundry is also not fixed. An online laundry booking system with proper page comprising of laundry appointments and all the entries can solve many problems.
 
    ```Just schedule your appointment, bag your laundry, and leave the rest to us!```
                                
 ## :star: [Leave Application](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSddBp568tu0gCQa4BK_5Fwo0qfBvekDejRCxwDYVaxpCUlrbA/viewform?usp=sf_link) 
- Going to reception, collecting forms, and getting them signed by n number of faculties is a great hassle. So our third idea is to create a centralised leave application form or webpage, though the webpage currently only has a Google Form attached to it; in the future, ideas like tallying attendance with a student's roll number and other such things can be integrated.It will be easier for a sick person to avail of medical leaves or, in case of emergency, get immediate leave. We are also thinking of modifiying this webpage as a centrailised student leave portal which will include Club leave, Event's leave many other small leaves. Having a live attendance counter will also make sure that a student always stays above that 75% attendance criteria.
