This project is used to fetch the  Favicons of some existing websites . <br/>

We need to enter the URL in the specified field and press the corresponding button . <br/>

We will be displayed with the Favicon of that website.


## CODE DETAILS

My project consists of hree files : <br/>

1. index.html -> All the HTML code of the project is prescent here.
2. styles.css -> ALl the Styles for styling the website are prescent here
3. script.js -> All the functionality of the project are prescent here.

I have used an API to fetch the favicons .
