Topic Name:- Music Player using JavaScript.

Tech stack used:- HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Description:- My music player allows you to listen music/song of your own choice. I have used javascript to control the music time, play next or previous song, pause & play. 
For now, I have only added 5 music but it can be enhanced by adding your favourite playlist.
