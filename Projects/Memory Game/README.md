## üß© Rules to play the Game

- To begin, you can press any Key or click anywhere other than tiles. (Don't click on any of the tiles)

- Then any of the four tiles will blink, remember that tile color. Click that same tile.
- The game would will end if you clicked the wrong tile. You'd have to start the game anew by pressing any key.
- If you clicked the correct tile, the level would rise & any tile would blink again: now you must click the previous tile, followed by the current tile, to raise the level.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Let's take an example

- Assume red blinks first, then blue blinks second:
   - The first tile in each sequence would be red; the second tile in each sequence would be blue.
   
- As the level rises, so will the sequence.
- The game goes on until you click the wrong tile.
