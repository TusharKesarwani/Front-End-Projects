This is the application which is been made using HTML , CSS and JavaScript. For the styling purpose I have also included the Bootstrap which is the CSS framework.
In this any user who runs the app just he need to execute the code and you will see the output on browser.Their just enter the website name that you wanted to bookmark
and make sure to enter the url of that website.Once you will submit these info the output will be displayed on the screen itself.

Sample output
![_usr_bin_bash --login -i 1_20_2023 2_31_36 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59620280/213712561-bd84306b-7bae-4d8f-a940-c6197fe00a54.png)
