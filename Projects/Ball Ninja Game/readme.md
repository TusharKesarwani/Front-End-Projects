Topic Name:- Ball Ninja Game

Tech stack used:- HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Description:- Ball ninja game is a clone of fruit ninja game. I tried to make fruit ninja game but due to unavailability of desired fruit images, I used balls to complete this project. I have used canvas on which the ball is drawn. The size, colour are choosen at random. This clone also has a feature of showing highest score acquired by the player and a current score to display the score of the current game. A time limit of 2 mins is given after which the game will over.
