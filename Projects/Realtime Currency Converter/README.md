The API used in this project is [Exchange Rate API](https://app.exchangerate-api.com/ "Exchange Rate API"), which provides accurate and up-to-date currency conversion data. To integrate a different API, you can modify the JavaScript code in `script.js` file to make requests and handle the response according to the API documentation.

Please note that you may need to sign up for an API key and update the code with your API key if required by the chosen API.
