# SmartNotezz-WebApp
SmartNotezz is a web based notes making and editing app. It enables users to keep track of their tasks and other to-do lists. The notes are stored into the local storage so that users need not worry about losing their data on exiting the page. By default, the notes are stored from most recent to oldest. A search option is made available to users for searching the title and locating their notes to avoid the hassle of scrolling down or up looking for a note.
