# Music-Player
As streaming is increasingly being adopted by users, online media players have become essential for consuming media on the internet. Music players allow one to enjoy music in any browser and supports a lot of the features of an offline music player.
I will be creating a music player with a clean user interface that can be used to play music in the browser. I will also implement features like seeking and volume control. HTML has several methods in the HTMLMediaElement interface that can be used to play audio files and control its playback without using any other library.
I will start by creating the HTML layout first that defines the structure of the player, make it look good by styling using CSS and then write the player logic for all the functions in JavaScript.
