## How to play
This application provides 4 functionality those are new game, roll dice, Hold dice, and win or lose based on the score.
- Firstly let's talk about **roll dice** functionality. It provides two type of features. 
  First, if it encounters dice with value 1 then the current player's current becomes zero and the turn of playing the game switches to the next player. 
  Secondly, if it doesn't have dice with value 1 it keeps adding the value on the current.
  
- Now let's talk about the **Hold dice** functionality. It only does one thing add the current value to the player's overall value.
- **Win or lose** depends on who gets the 100 points first.
- The **new game** just reset the game.
