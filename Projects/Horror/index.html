        <h2>Jamali Kamali</h2>
        <p>It is said that Jamali Kamali, despite its serene surroundings and the historical significance of its structures, is home to some paranormal activities. Visitors have reported experiencing strange and eerie sensations, including hearing disembodied voices and footsteps, seeing shadowy figures, and feeling sudden chills in certain parts of the site. Some have even claimed to have been physically pushed or scratched by an unseen force while exploring the premises.</p>
        <p>According to local legends, the source of these supernatural occurrences is the restless spirit of a woman who was buried in the tomb at Jamali Kamali. The woman was said to be a Sufi mystic named Jamali, who lived during the Mughal period and was revered for her wisdom and teachings. Her tomb is said to be the larger of the two structures at the site.</p>
        <p>It is believed that the woman's spirit is still present at the site and is responsible for the strange happenings. Some say that the ghost is benevolent and protects the site, while others claim that it is malevolent and seeks to harm those who disturb its rest.</p>
        <p>Despite these claims, there is no scientific evidence to support the existence of ghosts or paranormal activities at Jamali Kamali. Nevertheless, the site remains a popular destination for those interested in exploring the supernatural and experiencing the thrill of the unknown.</p>

        <h2>IIIT Bhubaneswar</h2>
        <p>The students of the IIIT Bhubaneswar had always known about the ghost that haunted the campus. But they never imagined that it would become a reality until one fateful night.</p>

        <p>It all began with a tragic accident that claimed the life of Pallavi, a promising engineering student with a bright future. Pallavi had been walking home from the library one night when a speeding car lost control and struck her. She died instantly, leaving her friends and family devastated.</p> 
            
        <p> After Pallavi's death, strange things began to happen on the campus. Students reported seeing her ghostly figure walking the same path she used to take every day, from the library to her hostel. They heard her whispers in the halls, and some even claimed to have seen her ghostly apparition in their dorm rooms.</p>
            
        <p> The college administration tried to dismiss the reports, but they could not ignore the mounting evidence. Soon, it became clear that Pallavi's spirit was still present on the campus, and she was not at peace.</p>
            
        <p>As the days went by, the haunting became more and more intense. Some students reported being pushed or shoved by an unseen force, while others claimed to have heard terrifying screams in the middle of the night.</p>
            
        <p>Finally, a group of brave students decided to investigate the haunting. Armed with cameras and recording equipment, they set out to capture evidence of Pallavi's ghostly presence.</p>
            
        <p>What they found was beyond anything they could have imagined. In the library, they discovered an old diary belonging to Pallavi, in which she had written about her dreams and aspirations for the future. But as they read further, they realized that Pallavi's death had shattered all her hopes and dreams, leaving her spirit trapped on the campus, unable to move on.</p>
