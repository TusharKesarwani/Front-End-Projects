## FLAPPY BIRD
Flappy bird flew into an endless pipe zone (or is it?) and needs help flying through to get out.  

# ABOUT THE GAME
A simple side-scrolling game where the player controls a bird to fly between pipes without hitting them.  Flying between each set of pipes scores 1 point and hitting them or the ground ends the game.  See how long you can last and set records.  


# TECHNOLOGY
 * HTML/CSS on canvas
 * JavaScript for game logic


# MVP

 * bird falls default to gravity
 * bird flies to 'click' (might be better for mobile capabilities)
 * pipes spawn top and bottom and scroll to the left

# STRETCH GOALS
 * animate bird

 * a customized theme
 * game is animated while waiting for player to start game
 * night time / day time
 * add a running time to display
 * make the game web responsive
