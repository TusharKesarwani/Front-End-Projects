        The services are provided by Publisherr Inc (parent company and
        hereinafter referred to as “Buy Me a Coffee”), a Delaware company with
        registered address at 2035 Sunset Lake Road, Suite B-2 Newark, DE 19702,

      <h1 class="bold__header">Website Visitors</h1>
      <div class="content__data">
        Like most website operators, Buy Me a Coffee collects
        non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and
        servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language
        preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor
        request. Buy Me a Coffee's purpose in collecting non-personally
        identifying information is to better understand how Buy Me a Coffee's
        visitors use its website. From time to time, Buy Me a Coffee may release
        non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by
        publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
      </div>
      <div class="content__data">
        Buy Me a Coffee also collects potentially personally-identifying
        information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users
        and for users making payments on BuyMeACoffee.com. Buy Me a Coffee only
        discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same
        circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying
        information as described below, except that payee IP addresses and email
        addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of Buy Me a
        Coffee and is handled by payment processors at the time of processing
        the payments.
      </div>
      <h1 class="bold__header">Payments</h1>
      <div class="content__data">
        To make a payment to a creator on Buy Me a Coffee, you have to provide
        our payment processor (Stripe) with your payment information. They
        provide us with a token that represents your account, your card’s
        expiration date, card type and the last four digits of your credit card.
        If you provide them with a name and email address then they also provide
        us with that information.

      <div class="content__data">
        We collect and process information about the creators you support, the
        level at which you support them, what rewards you receive and how often
        you support them.

        Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

      <div class="content__data">
        Certain visitors to Buy Me a Coffee's websites choose to interact with
        Buy Me a Coffee in ways that require Buy Me a Coffee to gather
        personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information
        that Buy Me a Coffee gathers depends on the nature of the interaction.
        For example, we ask visitors who sign up at BuyMeACoffee.com to provide
        a username and email address. Those who engage in transactions with Buy
        Me a Coffee are asked to provide additional information, including as
        necessary the personal and financial information required to process
        those transactions. In each case, Buy Me a Coffee collects such
        information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the
        purpose of the visitor's interaction with Buy Me a Coffee. Buy Me a
        Coffee does not disclose personally-identifying information other than
        as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply
        personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent
        them from engaging in certain website-related activities.
