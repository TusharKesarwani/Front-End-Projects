Welcome to the N-Queen Algorithm Visualizer! This project is a web application that allows you to visualize the N-Queen problem using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The N-Queen problem is a classic puzzle where you need to place N queens on an NÃ—N chessboard in such a way that no two queens attack each other. The goal of this visualizer is to demonstrate how the algorithm solves the N-Queen problem step by step.

## Introduction
The N-Queen Algorithm Visualizer is an educational tool that helps users understand how the N-Queen problem can be solved using a backtracking algorithm. The project provides an interactive chessboard interface where users can select the board size (N) and watch the algorithm in action, placing queens one by one until a valid solution is found. The visualization will show the backtracking process, highlighting the placement and removal of queens.

## Features
- Interactive chessboard where users can select the board size (N).
- Visualization of the backtracking algorithm to solve the N-Queen problem.
- Animation and highlights for each step of the algorithm for better understanding.
- Display of the final solution if a valid arrangement of queens is found.

## Technologies Used
The N-Queen Algorithm Visualizer is built using the following technologies:
- HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript for the frontend development.
- SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) for rendering the chessboard and queens.
- [Your Preferred JavaScript Library](https://library-url.com) (Optional - if using any specific JavaScript library).

## Setup
1. Clone the repository from GitHub.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
3. Choose the board size (N) for the N-Queen problem using the provided input or dropdown.
4. Click on the "Visualize" button to start the visualization.

## Usage
1. Once the visualization starts, the application will attempt to solve the N-Queen problem using the backtracking algorithm.
2. Watch as queens are placed on the chessboard one by one, attempting to find a valid solution.
3. Observe how the algorithm backtracks when it encounters conflicts and tries different arrangements until a solution is found or all possibilities are exhausted.
4. If a valid solution is found, the visualization will display the final arrangement of queens on the chessboard.

## Algorithm Explanation
The N-Queen problem is solved using a backtracking algorithm, which is a type of depth-first search. At each step, the algorithm attempts to place a queen on the board, and if a conflict is detected, it backtracks to the previous state and tries a different position. The process continues until a valid arrangement of queens is found or all possibilities are exhausted. The visualization will highlight each step, making it easier to understand the backtracking process.
