# Description
A split landing page, also known as an A/B test landing page or a multivariate landing page, is a web page that has been designed to test different versions of the same content or elements. The page is split into multiple versions, with each version containing a different variation of the design, copy, layout, or call-to-action. They can also be used in website optimization to increase the effectiveness of a website's overall design and user experience.
